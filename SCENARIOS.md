Describing Data with Graphs and Numerical Measures

**Scenario 1:**

RBC Counts The red blood cell count
of a healthy person was measured on each of
15 days. The number recorded is measured in 106 cells
per microliter (uL).
5.4 5.2 5.0 5.2 5.5
5.3 5.4 5.2 5.1 5.3
5.3 4.9 5.4 5.2 5.2
a. Use an appropriate graph to describe the data.
b. Describe the shape and location of the red blood cell
counts.
c. If the person’s red blood cell count is measured
today as 5.7  106/L, would you consider
this unusual? What conclusions might you
draw?

**Answer 1:**

a. Use an appropriate graph to describe the data.
For describing the distribution of data, a histogram is a commonly used visualization. A boxplot can also be used to describe the spread and central tendency of the data.
The histogram on the left shows the distribution of the red blood cell counts. Most of the counts seem to cluster around the 5.2 to 5.3 range. The boxplot on the right provides a summary of the data's spread and central tendency. 
The median (central line in the box) is around 5.3, with the interquartile range (the height of the box) spanning from roughly 5.2 to 5.4.

b. Describe the shape and location of the red blood cell counts.
From the histogram, we can provide a description of the shape and location of the data. The shape refers to the overall distribution (e.g., whether it's symmetric, skewed, etc.), and the location typically refers to the central tendency (e.g., mean, median).
The mean red blood cell count is 5.24×10^6 cells/L and the median is 5.2×10^6 cells/L. This indicates that the central location of the data is around these values.
As for the shape, the histogram suggests a roughly symmetric distribution, with a slight left skewness given that there's a minor tail on the left side.

c. To determine if the value 5.7×10^6 cells/L is unusual, we can calculate the standard deviation of the data and see how many standard deviations away from the mean this value lies. 
If it's more than 2 standard deviations away, it's typically considered unusual in many contexts.
The standard deviation of the red blood cell count data is approximately 0.154×10^6 cells/L. The value is roughly 2.99 standard deviations away from the mean.

Given that the value is nearly 3 standard deviations away from the mean, it would be considered unusual in most statistical contexts. 
A value lying more than 2 standard deviations away from the mean is often considered to be an outlier or atypical. Therefore, a red blood cell count of 5.7×10^6 cells/L 
might indicate some anomaly or change in the person's health, and it would be advisable to consult with a medical professional for a proper assessment.​

**Scenario 2**

Pulse Rates: A group of 50 biomedical
students recorded their pulse rates by
counting the number of beats for 30 seconds and
multiplying by 2.
80 70 88 70 84 66 84 82 66 42
52 72 90 70 96 84 96 86 62 78
60 82 88 54 66 66 80 88 56 104
84 84 60 84 88 58 72 84 68 74
84 72 62 90 72 84 72 110 100 58

a.Draw a stem and leaf plot to describe the data,
splitting each stem into two lines.

b. Construct a relative frequency histogram for the
data.

c. Write a short paragraph describing the distribution
of the student pulse rates.

**Answer 2:**

The pulse rates of the 50 biomedical students ranged from a low of 42 to a high of 110. The median pulse rate was 79, indicating that half of the students had pulse rates below this value and half above. The average pulse rate among the students was approximately 76.44. The middle 50% of the students had pulse rates that fell between 66 (1st quartile) and 84 (3rd quartile), giving an interquartile range (IQR) of 18.

The histogram of the pulse rates showed the distribution of these values among the students. From the histogram, it can be seen that the distribution has a slight right skew, with more students having pulse rates on the lower side of the average. There might be a few outliers or extreme values on the higher side, as indicated by the maximum value of 110.
